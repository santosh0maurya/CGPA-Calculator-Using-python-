# CGPA-Calculator-Using-python-
This tool helps calculate CGPA 

When I was in my first year of college, there was this confusion about the whole credit-based marking system used to find CGPAs. Also, after the exams we were so excited about the scores that we kept on speculating the results and calculating them. So later when I learned python in the second semester, I decided to create a simple application which makes this task easier for us.

So, this is a simple CGPA Calculator where you input the number of subjects, credits related to each subject and the marks you've scored in every subject and this calculator will calculate the CGPA for you.

Technologies used in this project:
